- 👋 Hi, I’m Mat the newb
- 👀 I’m interested in C/C++, Java, Python, C# NodeJS etc. to build Apps and Applications with REST features
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to implement REST features in Python on Raspberry
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate because I'm just this guy who does his own stuff
- 📫 People who know me reach me best via mail at worktime.
